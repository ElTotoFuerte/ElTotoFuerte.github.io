                        My name is Srishti, and I'm originally from India. Having earned my bachelor's and master's degrees in biotechnology, I'm now a doctoral candidate in Dr. Alexandra Cambier's laboratory at Sainte-Justine University Hospital Center in Canada. Passionate about immunology, I'm committed to understanding immune mechanisms to contribute to medical advancements, particularly in IgA nephropathy. From understanding the molecular mechanisms of immune responses to their impact on health, I strive to bridge the gap between theory and practice. I also explore new therapeutic avenues to revolutionize healthcare, with a vision of translating scientific discoveries into tangible benefits for society.

                        I completed my pediatric and pediatric nephrology training at the University of Paris in 2018. I then undertook my clinical fellowship in pediatric nephrology and kidney transplantation at Robert Debré Hospital in Paris. I obtained a PhD from the Doctoral School of Physiology, Pathophysiology and Therapeutics at Paris Diderot University. During my PhD, I conducted research on the fundamental role of CD89 in childhood IgA nephropathy at Bichat Hospital (Inflamex Inserm 1149 laboratory) under the supervision of Professor Renato Monteiro. I also worked on the role of collagen variants in IgA nephropathy with Professor Laurent Mesnard at Sorbonne University (UMR_S 1155 laboratory). My research focuses on the clinical specificities of IgA nephropathy in children, but also on the interest of immune biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease as well as the impact of genetic variants in the disease.
